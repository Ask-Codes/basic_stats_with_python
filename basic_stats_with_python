Linear Regression
The term regression is used when you try to find the relationship between variables (dependent and independent), which is used to predict the outcome of future events.
Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them. This line can be used to predict future values.
We must know relationship between the values of the x-axis and the values of the y-axis exist. If there is no relationship, then we cannot use the linear regression to predict future occurences.
The relationsip also known as coefficient of correlation is denoted as r. The value of r ranges from -1 to 1, where 0 means no relationship exist values of x and y, while 1 and -1 means positve and negative relationship respectively.

# Given the data

# To carry out a simple linear regression analysis
# First we import the following modulues:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for ploting of graphs for data visualization
from scipy import stats # for computing linear regression
import statistics # for computing basic statistics like mean, median, standard deviation etc.



Relationship between students' age and their performance
age (x) = [18, 21, 23, 34, 20, 35, 19, 24, 28, 25, 29, 30]
performance(y) = [5,10,15,10,6,8,4,10,11,3,6,12,16,7,9]

Relationship between company's sales of a product and price of the product (year)
Price (x) = []
sales(y) = []



Question 2: how good/well does my data fit in a linear regression Or Is there any relationship between the values in my data.
print (r) # shows the coefficient of correlation between the values

Bar Chart:
A bar chart is used to display categorical data using rectangular bars with lengths/heights proportional to the values they represent. 

How to plot a bar chart in python?
Matplotlib is a visualization library in python offering a number of chart options to display your data. To plot a bar chart you can use matplotlib pyplotâ€™s bar() function. The following is the syntax:
